# This challenge has been set by our mentor, Victor Goff.
# 
# Using what we have learned so far: I wonder if anyone could have a crack at working out the age in years and months form. For example “I’m 32 years and 6 months old.” Use the following values for age_in_seconds:

# age_in_seconds = 979000000
# age_in_seconds = 2158493738
# age_in_seconds = 246144023
# age_in_seconds = 1270166272
# age_in_seconds = 1025600095
# seconds_in_year = 365*24*3600
# seconds_in_month = seconds_in_year/12
# years = age_in_seconds/seconds_in_year # this gets truncated which is fine
# # puts years
# # puts years * seconds_in_year
# # puts age_in_seconds
# # puts (age_in_seconds - (years * seconds_in_year))
# months = (age_in_seconds - (years * seconds_in_year))/seconds_in_month
# 
# puts "I’m #{years} years and #{months} months old."
