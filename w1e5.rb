# Exercise 5
# 
# The following program prints the value of the variable. Why?
# 
 
def my_string
  'Hello World' 
end
my_string = 'Hello Ruby World' 
 
puts my_string

#  Because the last line of the method is returned
# Oops not thinking. Well not exactly sure, but the method is not called. I guess my_string is already set as a variable first, so the method is ignored.
